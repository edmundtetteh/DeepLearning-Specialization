# DeepLearning-Specialization
### This is my assignment on Andrew Ng's special course ["Deep Learning Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) This special course consists of five courses:

* [*Neural Networks and Deep Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)

* [*Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome)

* [*Structuring Machine Learning Projects*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome)

* [*Convolutional Neural Networks*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)

* [*Sequence Models*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

[**Neural Networks and Deep Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)

In this course, I learnt the foundations of deep learning which encompasses the following:

1. Major technology trends driving Deep Learning
2. Training and applying fully connected deep neural networks
3. Implementing efficient (vectorized) neural networks
4. Key parameters in a neural network's architecture
